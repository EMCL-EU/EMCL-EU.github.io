## Application process for admission and scholarships
First you need to register in Studielink: [https://www.studielink.nl/account/aanvragen/personalia](https://www.studielink.nl/account/aanvragen/personalia), then in our online application system Progress: (link tba). You will receive login details for the Online Application System via e-mail after you have applied in Studielink. Look for an e-mail titled: *"University of Groningen - Complete your application"*. Please make sure you complete all the steps in Progress until your application has the status *"Submitted"*.

In addition to uploading the other required documents (see above, ["Required documents"](#required-documents)) in Progress, you will need to ask your two academic referees to send their reference letter on letterhead to this email address: [emcl@rug.nl](mailto:emcl@rug.nl).
**Please make sure your referees mention in the subject title the following: your NAME, EMCL and STUDENT NUMBER (which you receive after registration in Studielink). Without this information the admissions office is not able to add these letters to your application package.**

Once you have submitted your application in Progress you will receive instructions on how to pay the application fee of € 74. 
Regarding those students who are unable to afford the application fee, coming from least developed countries and low income countries (see the list via [this link](https://www.oecd.org/dac/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-standards/DAC-List-of-ODA-Recipients-for-reporting-2022-23-flows.pdf)), an official request for a waiver can be send to the Board of Directors of the EMCL to [emcl@rug.nl](mailto:emcl@rug.nl), with the subject "request for waiver". 

Make sure that this request consists of the following items: 
- A formal letter with a letterhead and sender with your name, address of residency; 
- A motivation letter why you think you are eligible for the EMCL programme and why you need a waiver;
- Your CV, in a EuroPass format ([see details above](#required-documents)). 



*In case you do not want to be considered for a scholarship, but apply solely as a self-payer, please contact [emcl@rug.nl](mailto:emcl@rug.nl) for the procedure.*

### Application form
The application form is available in DOC (Microsoft Word) format [here](/files/application2024.doc).

### Deadline
Applications need to be submitted no later than **December 1, 2023**. (Application opens on Ocotber 9, 2023.)

You can already apply for the programme and we recommend you to submit your application well before the deadline, so that the Admissions Office can verify whether your application contains all the required documents.

## Tuition fee & scholarships
Each year, a certain number of scholarships are available through the Erasmus+ programme of the European Union. More information on the scholarship amounts can be found in [this document](/files/scholarships.pdf). 
Additionally, a limited number of students can be admitted as self-payers.

## Selection results
Applications are reviewed by a selection committee. The committee rates every single eligible application on the basis of the following criteria:

- academic quality
- motivation
- letters of reference (on letterhead)
- level of English

The review leads to two absolute ranked lists: one for the Partner Country students and one for the Programme Country students. Depending on the number of scholarships available, students will be placed on the main list or on a reserve list, according to their rank. Students will then be informed that they either 
- receive a scholarship
- can be admitted as a self-payer or 
- can not be admitted. 

Candidates who fail to meet the minimum admission requirements are declared ineligible and their applications are not further reviewed by the selection committee.

## Appeal procedure
All applicants have the right to appeal against the selection decision. This has to be done within a period of 15 days starting from the day after the notification of the outcome of the selection. Appeals, including supporting information, may be sent via e-mail to the selection committee at [emcl@rug.nl](mailto:emcl@rug.nl).
Please mention *Appeal* in the header of your e-mail. The selection committee will respond to the appeal within one month after its reception.
