You will receive login details for the Online Application System via e-mail after you have applied in Studielink. Look for an e-mail titled: *"University of Groningen - Complete your application"*.

You can already apply for the programme and we recommend you to submit your application well before the deadline, so that the Admissions Office can verify whether your application contains all the required documents.

## Selection results
Applications are reviewed by a selection committee. The committee rates every single eligible application on the basis of the following criteria:

- academic quality
- motivation
- letters of reference
- level of English

The review leads to two absolute ranked lists: one for the Partner Country students and one for the Programme Country students. Depending on the number of scholarships available, students will be placed on the main list or on a reserve list, according to their rank.
Candidates who fail to meet the minimum admission requirements are declared ineligible and their applications are not further reviewed by the selection committee.

## Appeal procedure
All applicants have the right to appeal against the selection decision. This has to be done within a period of 15 days starting from the day after the notification of the outcome of the selection. Appeals, including supporting information, may be sent via e-mail to the selection committee at [info@emcl.eu](mailto:info@emcl.eu).
Please mention *Appeal* in the header of your e-mail. The selection committee will respond to the appeal within one month after its reception.
