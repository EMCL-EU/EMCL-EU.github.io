# What is the EMCL++

EMCL++ is the successor of three Erasmus Mundus Joint Master Degree (EMJMD) editions spanning over twenty years of work in line with the objectives of attracting, selecting, and funding excellent students. The programme was conceived in 1997 by **Prof. Dr. Roelien Bastiaanse** and **Prof. Dr. Ria de Bleser**, and the first students started in 1999. After that, it obtained Erasmus Mundus labels in 2004, 2009, 2016 and 2020 – the last label grants the programme with continuity (and [scholarships!](/admission)) until 2026.

EMCL++ is organized as a consortium of three academic partners: **University Ghent (UGENT)**, **University of Groningen (RUG)**, and **University of Eastern Finland (UEF)**. At the RUG the emphasis is on crosslinguistic studies of language-impaired children and adults, on language testing in neurosurgical settings, and the usage of neurotechnology and IT for the diagnosis and treatment of language impairments. At UGENT students are familiarized with advanced topics in statistics and psycholinguistics, particularly, bilingualism, dyslexia, and eye tracking. Finally, at UEF, the main focus is on speech technology and programming with Python, both fundamental theory and methods and their application to assessment of and adaptive solutions for speech impairments. In addition, we count with the support of **23 associated partners**, of which 11 are in the academic sector, 4 in R&D/neurotechnology, and 8 in the clinical sector - for further details, see [here](/partners).

In every cohort, we welcome circa **twenty students** from all over the world (e.g., Europe, America, China, Indonesia, Ghana, Mexico, Mauritius, Nepal). These students hold a degree in **Linguistics, Psychology, Cognitive/Biomedical Sciences, Special Education, Speech and Language therapy or related disciplines.** Over two years, our students receive training in each of the academic partners, do a compulsory internship at one of the associated partners, and write an original master’s thesis. After that, 70% of our students **continue to do research in PhD programmes**. Furthermore, since 2017, we are seeing an increase in alumni that go for **R&D and clinical work**, making our programme sustainable and competitive in the international market.

All EMCL++ courses are recognized by each of the partners and there is a **joint grading system**, whereby the institutions recognize each other’s credits. Since 2019, we issue joint degrees accompanied by joint diploma supplements that fulfill all legal requirements of the three countries involved. A Joint **Master’s Degree of Science (MSc.)** for the programme has been implemented in 2012. For the new EMCL++ programme (2021-2026), which includes UGENT instead of the University of Potsdam, we also aim to award all successful students a joint degree. Arrangements are being made to achieve this goal during the preparatory year that the EU grants to awarded programmes.
