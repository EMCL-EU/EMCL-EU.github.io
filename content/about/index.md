# What is the EMCL++

**EMCL++** is the successor of EMCL+ and the integrated two-year Master’s programme offered jointly by a consortium of the Universities of Groningen (NL), Ghent (B) and Eastern Finland (FI) and more than 15 associated partners from the academic, R&D, and clinical sector, finishing with a joint MSc degree from the three institutions. It is a full-time interdisciplinary and transnational university programme at the Masters level, providing integrated training in neurolinguistics, psycholinguistics, and clinical linguistics. The aim of the Masters Course is to train highly qualified and advanced students to become excellently prepared for wide employability, by the unique combination of research training and an internship with an academic, R&D in neurotechnology, or clinical component. This is a prerequisite for interdisciplinary research in the fields of neurolinguistics and clinical linguistics and it shapes practitioners with a solid theoretical and experimental approach. The regular study period is 24 months. It consists of four semesters: three teaching semesters and a fourth semester to finish the internship and Masters thesis.

## Main Objectives
The European Master’s in Clinical Linguistics+ (EMCL+) is the successor to the European Master’s in Clinical Linguistics (EMCL) that was awarded the Erasmus Mundus label in 2004 and 2009 and 20156. In the new programme we build on our past experiences and look ahead: we wish to continue this master’s programme which has excellent content, and tailor it to meet the requirements of the employment market.

From the time of its conception in 1997, the EMCL (first enrolments 1999) was constructed to be an integrated, transnational, and transdisciplinary master’s programme in neurolinguistics and clinical linguistics. EMCL has been very successful and mainly focused on academic skills. The aims of the programme – to educate students to become excellent academic researchers - have been reached: more than 70% of the graduates take up PhD positions and by now, many of the alumni are working in academia as researchers, lecturers and even professors.

Looking ahead, we would like to maintain the excellence of this master’s course but also broaden the employment opportunities for our graduates, thereby making the programme more sustainable and creating capacity for the labour market. Therefore, the objectives of the EMCL++ programme are to offer a joint, full-time interdisciplinary and transnational university programme at the Masters level providing integrated training in neurolinguistics and clinical linguistics to prepare the students to employment in the academic, R&D and clinical field. To achieve this we are joining forces with academic partners with complementary expertise and from related disciplines and non-academic partners from the R&D (neurotechnology) and the clinical sector.

These associated partners have been selected because they are stakeholders and future employers. In EMCL++ an internship at one of these associated partners will be mandatory. These internships will offer EMCL students the opportunity to obtain experience worldwide: they can do an internship at one of the academic partners in programme countries: Australia (Macquarie University, Sydney; MQ); USA (City University, New York; CUNY); and Russia (Higher School of Economics, Moscow; HSE). 

Students can also chose for Universities in Europe, f.i. at the BCBL, the University of Copenhagen in Denmark or in Oslo, Norway. These universities offer knowledge in complementary fields, such as Speech Therapy, Neuropsychology and Cognitive Neuroscience. The R&D partners develop and/or apply the latest equipment for measuring brain activity, which is widely used in the field of neurolinguistics and clinical linguistics nowadays. One of the R&D partners is specialized in the development of digital tools for the assessment and treatment of cognitive disorders, including language. The clinical partners are university hospitals that apply awake brain surgery in brain tumour patients to prevent post-surgical language decline. During these operations, language abilities are tested. The university hospitals will not only offer internships, but also collaborate with the consortium on the development of a (free) Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) on this topic. The other partners from the clinical sector are rehabilitation centres where children and adults with speech and language disorders, the target groups for clinical linguistics, are treated.

# Content and structure
The programme is constructed from eight modules offered jointly by the partners, with full recognition of study achievements at the partner universities and using the ECTS system of workloads and grading. More information on the modules and courses can be found in the [Student Corner](../students).
