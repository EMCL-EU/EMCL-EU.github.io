EMCL++ offers a 24-month 120 ECTS full-time interdisciplinary and transnational university programme at the Master's level providing integrated training in experimental linguistics, neurolinguistics, psycholinguistics and clinical linguistics. The aim of EMCL is to train highly qualified advanced students who will be widely employable. Not only are students excellently prepared for research work and PhD programmes in the above fields, they will also be widely employable in the R&D and clinical sector, thanks to the inclusion of representatives from these sectors as associated partners in the programme.

# Main Objectives
The European Master’s in Clinical Linguistics++ (EMCL++) is the successor to the European Master’s in Clinical Linguistics (EMCL) that was awarded the Erasmus Mundus label in 2004 and 2009. In the new programme we build on our past experiences and look ahead: we wish to continue this master’s programme which has excellent content, and tailor it to meet the requirements of the employment market.

From the time of its conception in 1997, the EMCL (first enrolments 1999) was constructed to be an integrated, transnational, and transdisciplinary master’s programme in neurolinguistics and clinical linguistics. EMCL has been very successful, but to date has mainly been focused on academic skills. The aims of the programme – to educate students to become excellent academic researchers - have been reached: more than 70% of the graduates take up PhD positions and by now, many of the alumni are working in academia as researchers, lecturers and even professors.

# Content and structure
The programme is constructed from seven modules offered jointly by the partners, with full recognition of study achievements at the partner universities and using the ECTS system of workloads and grading. Courses and thesis research are structured within the following modules:

- M1: Start up Classes (Introductions to Statistics and Linguistics)
- M2: Language and culture classes (Finnish, Dutch)
- M3: Methods (including statistics and experimental linguistics)
- M4: Neurolinguistics and Psycholinguistics
- M5: Neurotechnology and IT for Clinical Linguistics
- M6: Internship (at one of the associated or full partners)
- M7: Masters thesis (including scientific writing, ethics, exposé)
- M8: Research extras (colloquia, reading circles, excursions, SOA-conference)

# Degree awarded
All successful EMCL+ students will receive their MSc as an Erasmus Joint Masters Degree.
